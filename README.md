The goal of this project is to provide to the `Power Platform community` a `kit` that will `help people start their DevOps journey with the Power Plaform`.

Whether you are:
- an experienced Power Platform or Dynamics 365 team who want to improve the quality and the delivery time of your deployments
- a citizen developer who wants an easy way to develop new features for your app on an isolated environment before sharing them with other members of your company

we will try to make this starter kit useful for you.

## What does the Power Platform ALM Starter Kit covers?

* Create a Power Platform environment and the corresponding service endpoint in Azure DevOps using a pipeline you can trigger manually
* Create a Power Platform service endpoint associated to an existing environment using a pipeline you can trigger manually
* Delete a Power Platform environment and the corresponding service endpoint in Azure DevOps using a pipeline you can trigger manually
* Delete a Power Platform service endpoint associated to an existing environment using a pipeline you can trigger manually

## How to deploy the Power Platform ALM Starter Kit?
### Prerequisites

To use this starter kit, you will need to have the following components already available:
- an Azure DevOps organization
- an Azure DevOps project with a repository
- the Power Platform Build Tools extension installed in your Azure DevOps organization
- a service principal registered in Azure DevOps with the following permissions and a client secret: `Dynamics CRM.user_impersonation` and `Microsoft Graph.User.Read`
- an Application User created on one of your existing Power Platform environments (for example the **Production** environment)
- a Power Platform Service Connection created in the considered Azure DevOps project associated to the Power Platform environment with the Application User previously configured
- a PAT (Personal access token) created for the considered Azure DevOps organization with `Full access` (at the moment, we are not able to clearly identify the access needed to enable a service connection for all pipelines)
- Add the **Contribute** permission to your project **Build Service** user account on your repository

### Step-by-step guide

1. Copy the `Pipelines` and `ServiceEndpoints` folders of this repository
2. Past it at the root of the repository of the Azure DevOps project you want to use
3. Create pipelines from all YAML pipeline definitions in the `Pipelines/Utils` folder manually adding the variables specified at the beginning of each pipeline definitions
4. Test the pipelines
